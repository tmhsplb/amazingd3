            Johannes Kepler was one of the first data scientists. The astronomer Tycho Brahe left Kepler reams
            of astronomical observation data from which Kepler was able to discover 3 laws of planetary motion.
            The first 2 of these laws state that
             <ol>
               <li>All planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.</li>
               <li>A line that connects a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.</li>
             </ol>
         </p>
         <p>
            Discovering these laws by themselves confirmed Kepler's prodigious powers of calculation and the
            accuracy of the voluminous measurements that Brahe had left him. But Kepler suspected that there
            was still another law hidden in the data, a law linking the orbits of the planets with each other.
            But even his powers of calculation were not up to the task. Until, that is, he was introduced to Napier's
            logarithms.
        </p>
         <p>
             The table on the left below comes from the website <a href="http://abitofauldmaths.org/" target="_blank">A Bit of Auld Maths.</a>.
             The table gives the period (T) in years of the orbit of each planet measured in Earth years
             and the length (R) of the semi-major axis of each planet, measured in millions of kilometers. The last
             two columns of the table list the logarithm base 10 of each of these two numbers. Imagine Kepler's thrill
             when he observed a linear relationship between the logarithms! In terms of the original variable R and T the linear
             relationship between the logarithms implied a power relationship among the corresponding orbits:
             <ol start="3">
                <li>The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.</li>
             </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the linking relation that Kepler suspected was hidden in the data. Newton later derived Kepler's
             3 laws as a consequence of his law of universal gravitation, using his development of the calculus.
             </p>

             Hover over each data point in the graph to see the planet it represents.
