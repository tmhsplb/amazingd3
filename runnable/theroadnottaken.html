        A poem! Seriously? What can a poem teach us about D3? We can certainly render a poem in simple HTML without the use of D3.
        But this poem was rendered using D3. It is a collection of 4 stanzas each having 5 verses. And each stanza is rendered in its own
        div. This example serves as an introduction to the topic of selections in D3.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without giving away too much, the poem is input into D3 as the following csv file.
        <br />
        <blockquote>
            <code>

                Stanza,Verse<br />
                1,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"<br />
                1,"And sorry I could not travel both"<br />
                1,"And be one traveler, long I stood"<br />
                1,"And looked down one as far as I could"<br />
                1,"To where it bent in the undergrowth"<br />
                2,"Then took the other, as just as fair"<br />
                2,"And having perhaps the better claim,"<br />
                2,"Because it was grassy and wanted wear"<br />
                2,"Though as for that, the passing there"<br />
                2,"Had worn them really about the same,"<br />
                3,"And both that morning equally lay,"<br />
                3,"In leaves no step had trodden back."<br />
                3,"Oh, I kept the first for another day!"<br />
                3,"Yet knowing how way leads on to way,"<br />
                3,"I doubted if I should ever come back."<br />
                4,"I shall be telling this with a sigh"<br />
                4,"Somewhere ages and ages hence:"<br />
                4,"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --"<br />
                4,"I took the one less traveled by,"<br />
                4,"And that has made all the difference."

        D3 supports input in csv format and this is in fact a principal means of providing a dataset to D3. The input for a given D3
        visualization may never be more complicated than a csv file. This makes D3 very easy to work with in the desktop environment.
